# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Project description

Project should have a R script called ```run_analysis.R``` that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to run the project

* Clone the repository and navigate to that directory using ```setwd()```
* Run the code using ```source('run_analysis.R')``` which will generate the tidy data set in the same directory with name ```tidy_data.txt```
